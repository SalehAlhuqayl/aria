- Sensitivity to train/val/test split seeds

## Additional Results
- Error analysis by `Make`, `Region`, and `Year` bands
- Learning curves for XGBoost and Random Forest
- Ablation: remove engineered features to measure impact

## Additional Figures
- Residual plots for best and baseline models
- SHAP summary and dependence plots for top features
- Box plots of price by region and make

## Data Tables
- Summary table of feature cardinalities and missingness
- Metric table for all models across multiple seeds
