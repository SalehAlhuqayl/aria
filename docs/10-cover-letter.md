Dear Editor,

We submit our manuscript, “Machine Learning Reveals Determinants of Used Car Prices in Saudi Arabia,” for your consideration. Our work presents a reproducible pipeline that delivers accurate price predictions (XGBoost RMSE 13,728 SAR; R^2 0.965) and clear insights into how mileage, age, and brand/model shape market value.

This study addresses a practical, high-impact problem at the intersection of data science and economics. It contributes a transparent methodology and actionable findings for consumers, dealers, and policy makers. The code and artifacts are available in the repository to facilitate replication.

We believe the manuscript will interest your readership given its methodological rigor and applied relevance. We confirm that the work is original and not under review elsewhere.

Sincerely,
